# TXdotTrafficCamera
This makes a request to its.txdot.gov for a pre-selected traffic camera.  The script then decodes the base64-encoded image and displays it in a PowerShell forms application for easy viewing.  There is a portion commented out which will save the decoded image to the user's Downloads folder also.
